            Introducing my project - a password manager that keeps your passwords safe and secure. With this password manager, you can securely store your passwords, all protected by a master password.
            </p>
            <p>
            The registration process ensures that the password is strong and meets the necessary requirements, such as a minimum length of 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one symbol. Once you have registered, you can add passwords to the vault, which are then encrypted using a high-security encryption algorithm that derives the encryption key from the hashed master password and salt.
            </p>
            <p>
            You can view your password vault, where you can check the passwords you have saved, and also delete or edit them. If you make changes to a password, the password manager will encrypt the new password and send it to the database.
            </p>
            <p>
            In addition, you can change your master password anytime, ensuring that you keep your account safe and secure. This password manager is an easy-to-use and reliable solution that makes managing your passwords effortless and worry-free.
