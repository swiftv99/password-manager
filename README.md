# Password Manager with Encryption

This is an easy-to-use password manager with encryption for secure password storage. The password manager allows users to register an account, log in, and store their passwords securely in a password vault. The passwords are encrypted using a high-security encryption algorithm that derives the encryption key from the hashed master password and salt, ensuring that even if someone gains access to the password vault, they won't be able to read the passwords without the master password.

## Features

- Registration process with password strength requirements
- Password vault to securely store passwords
- View, delete, or edit saved passwords
- High-security encryption algorithm to encrypt passwords
- Change master password anytime
- Easy-to-use and reliable solution

## Description

The registration process ensures that the password is strong and meets the necessary requirements, such as a minimum length of 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one symbol. This ensures that the password is secure from the start. Once the user has registered, they can add passwords to the password vault, where the passwords are securely stored and protected by a master password. The user can view their password vault, check the passwords they have saved, and also delete or edit them.

To ensure that the passwords are always safe and secure, the password manager encrypts them using a high-security encryption algorithm that derives the encryption key from the hashed master password and salt. This means that even if someone gains access to the password vault, they won't be able to read the passwords without the master password. When the master password changes, the password manager re-encrypts all passwords in the vault with the new master password, ensuring that the account remains safe and secure.
